## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project features several little examples:

- A basic `node` `http` web server in `node-http/`.
- An `express` version of the same server in `node-express/`.
- A local `mongodb` in `mongodb/`.
- A `node` server which communicates directly with the `mongodb` through a `mongo client` in `node-mongo/`.
- Another version of the previous one, but using `mongoose` in `node-mongoose`.
- A more complex `node` server which communicates to the local `mongodb` and exposes an API for fetching and saving data related to a restaurant. This backend is open at two ports: 3000 and 3443. The port 3000 is insecure (over `http`) and redirects to the 3443 port, which is secure (`https` server with self-signed certificate).
- Finally, another version of the previous backend, bootstrapped using `loopback`.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

All applications can be run with `npm start` (previous `npm install` for installing the dependencies).

For all the applications related to the `mongodb`, the local database must be running in parallel:

```bash
mongod --dbpath=mongodb --bind_ip 127.0.0.1
```

And then start the application with `npm start`.
